# Companion Triggers
# Automated actions that fire based on conditions or schedules.
#
# Companion supports triggers that can:
#   - Fire on a schedule (time-based)
#   - Fire on variable change
#   - Fire on connection status change
#
# This file is a placeholder. Triggers will be configured after
# the base button layout is working and tested.

triggers:

  # === Placeholder: Auto-reconnect on connection loss ===
  # - name: "auto_reconnect_propresenter"
  #   condition: "connection_lost"
  #   connection: "propresenter"
  #   delay_ms: 5000
  #   actions:
  #     - connection: "internal"
  #       action: "connection_disable"
  #       options:

  #   schedule:
  #     day: "sunday"

notes: |
  Triggers are an advanced Companion feature.
  Start with manual button control, add triggers after the core system is stable.
  Common trigger patterns for church use:
  - Auto-reconnect on connection loss
  - Scheduled startup before service
  - Auto-record when streaming starts
  - Warning flash when timer expires
