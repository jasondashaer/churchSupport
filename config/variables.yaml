# Companion Custom Variables
# These variables are used across pages for dynamic button text and logic.
#
# Companion provides built-in variables like:
#   $(internal:time_hms)     - Current time HH:MM:SS
#   $(internal:time_s)       - Epoch seconds (for calculations)
#   $(internal:date)         - Current date
#   $(propresenter:*)        - ProPresenter state variables
#   $(obs:*)                 - OBS state variables
#   $(atem:*)                - ATEM state variables
#
# Custom variables defined here supplement the built-in ones.

custom_variables:

  - name: "startup_status"
    default: "READY"
    description: "Tracks system startup progress"
    values:
      - "READY"       # System ready for startup
      - "STARTING"    # Startup sequence in progress
      - "COMPLETE"    # All systems online
      - "ERROR"       # One or more systems failed to connect

  - name: "service_day"
    default: "sunday"
    description: "Current service type (affects preset selection)"
    values:
      - "sunday"      # Sunday service presets
      - "midweek"     # Midweek service presets
    notes: |
      OPEN QUESTION: Can this be auto-detected from day of week?
      Companion's $(internal:time_s) can be used with math to determine day.
      Alternative: Use two separate startup buttons instead of auto-detection.

  - name: "service_phase"
    default: "pre"
    description: "Current phase of the service (for reference display)"
    values:
      - "pre"           # Pre-service
      - "announcements"
      - "fellowship"
      - "worship"
      - "sermon"
      - "prayer"
      - "post"          # Post-service
    notes: "Optional - used if displaying current service phase on buttons"
